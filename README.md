What websites offer good encryption?
=============

Recently I wrote a
[tutorial on the secure settings of SSL/TLS in your browser][]. In the
[german version][] I asked for sites which don't work with TLS 1.1 or
better. Several people replied and told about non-working sites. I
decided to collect and publish a list. The current list can be found
here:

https://kubieziel.de/computer/ssl-tls.html

If you know about other sites please edit the file
[https://github.com/qbi/ssl-tls-sites/SSL-TLS.org](SSL-TLS.org) or the
[https://pad.riseup.net/p/SSL-TLS](Pad).
