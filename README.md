Project ceased
==============

I have stopped working on that project. It is archived for documentation purposes.

What websites offer good encryption?
=============

Recently I wrote a
[tutorial on the secure settings of SSL/TLS in your browser][]. In the
[german version][] I asked for sites which don't work with TLS 1.1 or
better. Several people replied and told about non-working sites. I
decided to collect and publish a list. The current list can be found
here:

If you know about other sites please edit the file [SSL-TLS.org][].
